# Vitalis Clinic

Simple website built with **HTML5** and **CSS** to present a preventive health clinic. The project demonstrates the requested fundamentals: semantic structure, multi-page navigation, inline/internal/external styles, CSS selectors, the box model, pseudo-classes, flexbox, grid, floats, and more.

## Project structure
- `index.html`: landing page with hero, highlighted services, and explanatory sections.
- `services.html`: medical services catalog with grid and flex demonstrations.
- `contact.html`: contact page with internal styles, a simple form, and an overflow example.
- `style.css`: shared stylesheet linked from every page.

## How to browse
1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
2. Use the navigation menu to move between Home, Services, and Contact.
3. Test the links and hover effects to see the configured pseudo-classes.

## Biggest challenge
Balancing multiple layout requirements (floats, flexbox, and grid) in one design without sacrificing clarity was the toughest part. Organizing CSS rules by section and adding descriptive comments helped avoid specificity conflicts.
