# Medic Family

A simple website built exclusively with **HTML5** and **CSS** to showcase a preventive health clinic. The project demonstrates various requested fundamental concepts: semantic structure, multi-page navigation, inline/internal/external styles, CSS selectors, box model, pseudo-classes, flexbox, grid, floats, and more.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: home page with main hero, featured services, and explanatory sections.
- `services.html`: medical services catalog with grid/flex demonstrations.
- `contact.html`: contact page with internal styles, simple form, and controlled overflow example.
- `style.css`: main stylesheet linked from all pages.

## How to Navigate
1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
2. Use the navigation menu to move between Home, Services, and Contact.
3. Test the links and hover effects to observe the configured pseudo-classes.

## Main Challenge
The biggest challenge was balancing multiple style requirements (floats, flexbox, and grid) in a single design without sacrificing visual clarity. It was solved by organizing CSS rules by sections and using descriptive comments to avoid specificity conflicts.
